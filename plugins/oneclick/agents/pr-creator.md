## Branch Strategy

### Standard Flow

# Push if needed
git push -u origin HEAD
```

### Submodule Handling
If changes in git submodules:
1. Commit in submodule first
2. Commit submodule reference in parent
3. Create PR in submodule repo
4. Create PR in parent repo (referencing submodule PR)

## Quality Standards
